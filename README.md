# Email with Instructions
Dear Felix,

Thank you for registering for the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning" course. We have sent you the Webex login details, I hope you have received it, if not please do let me know.

To access the training materials, please follow the below mentioned steps-

Login to http://juliabox.com/up/aipro/AIPRO500K. You can login using either your GitHub, Linkedin or Google account

Once you login, agree to terms and conditions
Click on "Training"
Click on "ICCML" - You will be able to access the training materials.
You need not install any development environment on your computers. JuliaBox lets you run Julia in Jupyter notebooks right in the browser.

The notebook in JuliaBox might get updated before the training session.

In case you have any queries tomorrow, please reach out to -

Ranjan - ranjan@juliacomputing.com 
Sanjeeb - sanjeeb@juliacomputing.com

Both of us will be available on google hangout as well.

Dear Felix,
We are excited that you are joining us for the Introduction to AI/ML training session! We hope 
you were able to log in using our special link. 
 
We just have some last instructions to get you set up: 
1.	Once you login, click on the Packages tab at the top-left of your package. This should 
open up a window called Package Builder 
2.	Click on the Yours tab.  
3.	In the "Unregistered Packages" box, 
paste: https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl.git, and click +" 
4.	In the Julia version section, make sure v0.6.2 is selected.  
5.	 Click Start.  
6.	 A prompt may open up saying it may take a while. Click OK  
Wait for this process to complete. It shouldnt take more than 5 minutes. 
If you have any trouble with this process, please email - Ranjan (ranjan@juliacomputing.com). 
Here are a couple of troubleshooting tips just in case you face any issues. 
Troubleshooting notes: 
1.	If at any point you do not see the same material that the instructor is presenting, try 
renaming your training folder, logging out and logging in again through the special link. 
You should see a new folder with the updated material.  
2.	Whenever you open a new notebook, it is recommended you shut down the old 
notebook (Notice the yellow shutdown button pop up at the top when you select a 
notebook). Every participant is provided limited memory and compute, so shutting down 
old notebooks frees up some resources.  
3.	If you ever get a Dead kernel issue whenever you open a notebook (and it occurs 
repeatedly), click on the packages tab at the top left of your Juliabox window. You 
should see a yellow button called Reset. Click on it and wait for it to reset your Julia 
packages. You might also have add to Metalhead again (refer to instructions above.) 
Good luck, and hope you enjoy the training!
If you ever face any technical difficulties, please send a private message to Ranjan/Abhijith on 
the webex chat.
