    "In the previous notebooks, we've seen that by changing **parameters** in a function, we could find a \"best fit\" of that function to some data. We use a **loss function** to quantify the \"goodness\" of a set of parameters and we look for those parameters that **optimize**, in fact **minimize**, the loss function. If we teach a machine how to minimize the loss function on its own, we say that machine is able to **learn** how to model our data.\n",

    "In the last notebook, we threw around terms like **derivative**, **gradient**, and **gradient descent** to give you a rough sense of how we minimize a function on a computer. In this notebook, we will step through these concepts more carefully, with the aim of being able to implement them using Julia."
